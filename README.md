# Abbilities

- If Empress is active and kills an enemy will automatically heals you if the soul is existing.

- .[C] Leer = Throw an eye which enemy will not attack you if it exists + Some Bonuses on it , it heals the enemy if it exists and if the eye touches the enemy it deals damage.
- .[Q] Devour = If the soul orb exists and presses on it it heals you + if you have Empress On it gives Big Movement Speed
- .[E] Dismiss = same as Devour but it not heals or do damage. it gives more big movement speed than normal if you have Empress On it , makes you invulnerable + invisible to enemy eyes.
- .[X] Empress = Gives more fire speed , reload speed , and enhance abbilities , [Q And E] Amounts make it infinite , If you kill an enemy the Empress will reset its cooldown.
